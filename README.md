### Overview

Auth-Server is a small API server that allows its users to create, authenticate, login, and delete a user from a local JSON file (_local database -_ `users.json`).
It has four API end point:
| API Endpoint | Expected Value | Retruned Value | Error Message |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `/createUser`| `{ username: Stirng, password: String }` | `{ jwt = String, username: String }` | `{ message: String }` |
| `/login` | `{ username: Stirng, password: String }` | `{ jwt = String, username: String }` | `{ message: String }` |
| `/auth` | `{ jwt: String }` | `{ uid: String, username: String }` | `{ message: String }` |
| `/removeUser`| `{ username: Stirng, password: String }` | `{ message: username + " is removed." }` | `{ message: String }` |

### Installation

The following steps explain the simple steps to run this server:

1. Clone the project into your machine
2. Make sure the `users.json` is just an empty array `[]`
3. Open the `.env` file and replace `"INSERT_SECRET_KEY"` with your own secret key <ins>**(NO QUOTES)**</ins> as well as the port number
4. Open terminal `cd` into your directory and run `node .`

### Testing

In order to pass the tests, make sure that the `users.json` is just an empty array `[]`. After that, `cd` into the director and run `npm run test`

### Notes to be aware of

In the file `db.js` there is a function named `deleteUser(uid, username)` on `line 52`. This function is responsible for receiving the `uid` and the `username` of a user and check it across the local databse `users.json` then removes the user. However, after removing it, it returns an array of all users as well as a boolean to confirm if the user is deleted or not `return { newUsers, deleted };`. The `newUsers` array is returned for testing pusposes only. If this is being used to run the server, than it should only return the deleted variable in the object as follows `return { deleted };`
